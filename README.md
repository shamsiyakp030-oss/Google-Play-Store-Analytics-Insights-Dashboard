## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shamsiyakp030-oss/Google-Play-Store-Analytics-Dashboard.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd Google-Play-Store-Analytics-Dashboard
```

If your Streamlit application is inside the nested `Google_Play_Analytics_Internship_Project` directory, navigate into that folder before continuing.

### 3. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Launch the application

```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

The dashboard will be available in your browser at the local Streamlit address, typically `http://localhost:8501`.

## 💡 Business Insights

The dashboard supports exploration of questions such as:

* Which app categories have the highest number of applications?
* How are app ratings distributed across categories?
* What patterns exist between reviews and installs?
* How do application sizes relate to ratings?
* Which categories show different installation patterns?
* What trends can be explored through update dates and category-level analysis?

These analyses can help users understand application performance and investigate potential market opportunities. Findings depend on the selected data and filters.

## Final Project Structure

- `app.py` — Streamlit landing/dashboard page
- `pages/` — six analytics modules
- `utils/` — shared cleaning, filters, and IST access control
- `data/googleplaystore.csv` — primary Google Play dataset
- `data/googleplaystore (2).csv` — enriched dataset used by the calendar heatmap (sentiment fields included)
- `data/googleplaystore_with_country.csv` — dataset variant containing the Country field
- `requirements.txt` — deployment dependencies

### Deployment

Run locally with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The dashboard pages intentionally use separate IST access windows as specified by the internship project requirements.

The Sunburst page labels the country hierarchy as **Global** when the selected dataset has no genuine country field; it does not fabricate country-level results.
